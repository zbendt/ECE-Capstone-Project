#	Inventor Files

For this project there was quite a few custom designed mechanical structures that were needed. These included small things like simple fasteners or mounts to 
more complex components, like a 3 point motor mounting platform and electrical covers. Each directory is named for the parts it contains and we have sorted
the parts by source to try and give some organization to the overall directory. For example, parts that are sourced externally (bought or given) from 
a site such as McMaster Carr are sorted into the McMaster directory. Simple parts such as bolts, nuts, etc are not sourced explicitly (because they are 
so prevalent) and are instead just placed into a general directory called "Metric Bolts" or "Metric Nuts" 

Below is a general description of the different directories and what they contain 


## ![Custom Delta](https://github.com/Jbruslind/ECE44x_Senior_Design/tree/master/Mechanical/Project%20Model%20Files/Inventor%20Files/Custom_Delta)

This directory contains all of the custom made components for the current revision of the Delta robot. All of the files contained in this directory have 
been custom made/designed/modeled by Jorian Bruslind. 

## Delta Bot

This directory contains the original file for a base model Delta robot designed by daGHIZmo on Thingiverse. We used this as a model reference to see 
how a Delta robot looks like using 3D printed components. I highly recommend to check out his thingiverse profile, it has got some great stuff

## McMaster Files

We purchased most of our mechanical system from McMaster Carr as they had the best selection and prices for easy to use fasteners/material. Each file 
contained in this directory has the McMaster part number as a prefix in its name (for easy reference). 

## Digikey Files

We also purchased quite a few parts from digikey although these were more electrically related than mechanical. The mechanical parts that were purchased 
were mostly connectors to interface with the stepper motors we purchased. In addition this directory also contains a model for the Raspberry PI 4 and 
Raspberry Pi Camera v2.0 (both were used in the system). 

## Sparkfun Files 

The only component actually bought from Sparkfun was a stepper shaft collar that allowed easy mounting access for our armatures. The step file (and ipt file) 
for this is contained in this directory. 

## Metric Nuts/Bolts

For this project we tried to maintain metric as our standard measurement of choice due to its ubiquity in engineering and ease of use (simple, rounded numbers). 
As such we have a general repository of metric bolts/nuts that we used in our models. This section does not have a specific supplier because we bought 
these parts from various suppliers (Amazon, McMaster, local hardware stores, etc)
