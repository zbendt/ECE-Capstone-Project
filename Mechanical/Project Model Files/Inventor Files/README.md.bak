#	Inventor Files

For this project there was quite a few custom designed mechanical structures that were needed. These included small things like simple fasteners or mounts to 
more complex components, like a 3 point motor mounting platform and electrical covers. Each directory is named for the parts it contains and we have sorted
the parts by source to try and give some organization to the overall directory. For example, parts that are sourced externally (bought or given) from 
a site such as McMaster Carr are sorted into the McMaster directory. Simple parts such as bolts, nuts, etc are not sourced explicitly (because they are 
so prevalent) and are instead just placed into a general directory called "Metric Bolts" or "Metric Nuts" 

Below is a general description of the different directories and what they contain 

## Custom Delta

This directory contains all of the custom made components for the current revision of the Delta robot. All of the files contained in this directory have 
been custom made/designed/modeled by Jorian Bruslind. 

## Delta Bot

This directory contains the orignial file for a base model Delta robot designed by daGHIZmo on Thingiverse. We used this as a model reference to see 
how a Delta robot looks like using 3D printed components. I highly reccomend to check out his thingiverse profile, it has got some great stuff

## McMaster Files

## Digikey Files

## Sparkfun Files 

## Metric Nuts/Bolts


##	UWROV19

This project is the Underwater ROV team 2018-2019 circuit board files. All of these were custom designed to fit with 
the ROV.
